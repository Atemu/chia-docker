# What is Chia?

Chia is a new blockchain and smart transaction platform that is more efficient, decentralized, and secure.

Chia Network develops a blockchain and smart transaction platform created by the inventor of BitTorrent, [Bram Cohen](https://consent.yahoo.com/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_51f38948-4182-4aaa-819b-acc8787d9490&lang=en-GB&inline=false). It implements the first new Nakamoto consensus algorithm since Bitcoin in 2008. Proofs of Space and Time replace energy intensive “proofs of work.”

### Healthcheck

A script called `healthcheck.sh` is copied into `/usr/local/bin`. It's a bit of a hack but this can be used to check the health of the service. Here is an example of how it can be used with Hashicorp Nomad + Consul;

```
# Registers service with consul for service discovery
service {
  name = "chia-node"
  port = "rpc"

  tags = [
    "private"
  ]

  check {
    name     = "alive"
    type     = "tcp"
    interval = "10s"
    timeout  = "2s"
  }

  # Need to use a script check because the HTTP request to chia node must contain a body which cannot be done specified in the check stanza
  check {
    name     = "get_blockchain_state"
    type     = "script"
    command  = "/bin/bash"
    args     = ["/usr/local/bin/healthcheck.sh"]
    interval = "10s"
    timeout  = "5s"

    check_restart {
      # Restart after 2 consecutive failures
      limit = 2
      # After restarting do not check health for 90s
      grace = "90s"
      ignore_warnings = false
    }
  }
}
```

When it fails the Chia node is restarted by Nomad;

```
