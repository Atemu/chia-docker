# What is Chia?

Chia is a new blockchain and smart transaction platform that is more efficient, decentralized, and secure.

Chia Network develops a blockchain and smart transaction platform created by the inventor of BitTorrent, [Bram Cohen](https://consent.yahoo.com/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_51f38948-4182-4aaa-819b-acc8787d9490&lang=en-GB&inline=false). It implements the first new Nakamoto consensus algorithm since Bitcoin in 2008. Proofs of Space and Time replace energy intensive “proofs of work.”

### Notes

Currently chia is hardcoded to run an rpc server on localhost which fails in docker containers that do not have network mode of `host`. To work around this issue this image replaces the hardcoded `localhost` with `chia` before compiling.

If you want to use the rpc server (enabled by default) and not use network mode of `host` you will need to give your container a hostname of `chia`.
